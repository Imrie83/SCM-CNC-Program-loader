# SCM-CNC-Program-loader
This programme has been written for SCM M100 machines.
It is watching a folder specified in a file_path.txt and once a new .pgm file (generated by Alphacam) is detected the script loads it in to the Panel Mac with alternate bed names (AB and DC) for the operator.

The idea here is to eliminate a possibility for the operator to accidentally pick the wrong programme or load it on to a wrong be, thus lowering a number of a user-error scraps.
